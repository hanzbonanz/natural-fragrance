        <h3>STEP 1: Successful Scent Blending</h3>

        <p> Perhaps the most difficult part of creating your own fragrance is choosing scent essences which will smell nice together.  The following method uses trial and error to help you find combinations which suit your scent palate.</p>
        
        <p> 
          <ol>
            <li>Choose several scent essences you think you'd like in your blend</li>
            <li>Put a drop of each essence onto its own scent strip</li>
            <li>Pick three scent strips and hold them in a fan-like fashion so that the section of each strip with the oil on it is not touching any of the other strips (to ensure that your scent strip only smells like one essence)</li>
            <li>Wave the scent combination under your nose to get an idea of how the blend would smell</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've found a combination you'd like to turn into a fragrance</li>
          </ol>
        <p>This method is great since it allows you to find scent combinations without wasting ingredients, since you only need to use a drop of each oil. Scent essences made from  jasmine, rose, oud, sandalwood, etc., can be very expensive and therefore you will want to limit their use to scent creations you will want to actually wear.  </p>

        <h4>Blending Tips:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Florals and citruses blend well with a lot of other scents </li>
            <li>Spicy notes are usually difficult to blend with, but tend to go well with sweet scents </li>
            <li>Try blending with essences that smell similar to each other </li> 
            <li>Limit your creations to three or even just two notes until you gain more blending experience</li>
            <li>Use fragrance recipes! Just like learning to cook, following recipes can help you build confidence and to gradually learn which scents go well together</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Create Your Fragrance</h3>

        <p>Now that you've decided which scent essences you'd like to blend with, it's time to roll up your sleeves and make your fragrance. While the overall process is simple, keeping track of measurements and percentages requires attention.   <!-- We'll make use a few tools to help us manage our calculations and to save recipes for future reference. --></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Get your notebook ready, and take note of exactly which ingredients you use and how much of each one you add to your creation. When it comes to details, the more you keep track of the better. For example, rose absolute from Bulgaria smells quite different than rose absolute from Turkey.  Basil oil with high linalool content smells sweet while basil high in eugenol smells spicy like cloves. It's a good idea to keep track of where you purchased the essence, the species name including subspecies if applicable, where it was produced, and how it was produced (steam distilled, CO2 extraction, etc.) </li>
