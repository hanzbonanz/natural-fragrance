        <h3>STEP 1: Successful Scent Blending</h3>

        <p> Perhaps the most difficult part of creating your own fragrance is choosing scent essences which will smell nice together.  The following method uses trial and error to help you find combinations which suit your scent palate.</p>
        
        <p> 
          <ol>
            <li>Choose several scent essences you think you'd like in your blend</li>
            <li>Put a drop of each essence onto its own scent strip</li>
            <li>Pick three scent strips and hold them in a fan-like fashion so that the section of each strip with the oil on it is not touching any of the other strips (to ensure that your scent strip only smells like one essence)</li>
            <li>Wave the scent combination under your nose to get an idea of how the blend would smell</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you've found a combination you'd like to turn into a fragrance</li>
          </ol>
        <p>This method is great since it allows you to find scent combinations without wasting ingredients, since you only need to use a drop of each oil. Scent essences made from  jasmine, rose, oud, sandalwood, etc., can be very expensive and therefore you will want to limit their use to scent creations you will want to actually wear.  </p>

        <h4>Blending Tips:</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Florals and citruses blend well with a lot of other scents </li>
            <li>Spicy notes are usually difficult to blend with, but tend to go well with sweet scents </li>
            <li>Try blending with essences that smell similar to each other </li> 
            <li>Limit your creations to three or even just two notes until you gain more blending experience</li>
            <li>Use fragrance recipes! Just like learning to cook, following recipes can help you build confidence and to gradually learn which scents go well together</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Take Notes</h3>

        <p>Now that you've decided which scent essences you'd like to blend with, it's time to roll up your sleeves and make your fragrance. While the overall process is simple, keeping track of measurements and percentages requires attention.   <!-- We'll make use a few tools to help us manage our calculations and to save recipes for future reference. --></p>
        <p>Get out a notebook and pen (or your laptop), and take note of exactly which ingredients you use and how much of each one you add to your creation. When it comes to details, the more you keep track of the better. For example, rose absolute from Bulgaria smells quite different than rose absolute from Turkey.  Basil oil with high linalool content smells sweet while basil high in eugenol smells spicy like cloves. It's a good idea to keep track of where you purchased the essence, the species name including subspecies if applicable, where it was produced, and how it was produced (steam distilled, CO2 extraction, etc.)</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Choose Your Batch Size</h3>
        <p>  It's important to decide how large your batch will be.  Making a batch of 100 mL can make measurements more simple, as the percentages of each ingredient will be equal to the number of mLs added.  For example, say you want to make a fragrance which has a scent strength of 15% (meaning that your total scent essences make up 15% of the fragrance).  Since 100 mL = 100 %, you know that you will need a total of 15 mL of scent essences. Finally, we know that we will need 85 mL of alcohol to make up the remaining 85% of the solution. If you would like to have a different batch size, you will need to calculate the desired ingredient percentages by hand. </p><!-- or use this handy fragrance calculator -->

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Step 4: Choose Your Scent Strength</h3>
        <p>Decide how strong you want your batch to be.  15% is a typical strength, but you could make it lighter if the scent will be used as a body splash or stronger if you want a more concentrated scent.</p>
        <br>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Step 5: Blend Together Your Scent Essences</h3>
        <p>Get out a glass beaker which is at least as large as your batch size.  Using a separate plastic pipette for each essence, measure the desired amount of essence and drop it into your glass beaker.  Say for example you decide to make a 100 mL batch size, with a 15% scent strength, and you'd like to blend with three different essences (recommended if this is your first batch).  Here you can simply add 5 mL of each scent essence, for a total of 15 mL.  You can also try using another ratio, for example 7/5/3 mL, 6/6/4 mL, 9/3/3 mL, or whatever you would like. </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Step 6: Add the Alcohol and Water</h3>
        <p>After you've added all your essences together, it's time to add your alcohol and water to the batch. If you have chosen to make a 100 mL batch at 15% scent strength, the remaining alcohol and water portion needs to add up to 85 mL.  For most fragrances, it works well to use 84 mL of alcohol and 1 mL of water (which simply translates to 84% alcohol and 1% water).  You could try adding more water than this, but if you add too much water your solution will become cloudy and the scent essences may begin to separate.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Step 7: Freezing and Filtering the Batch</h3>
        <p>At this point your fragrance is in it's raw stage, and technically you could bottle it at this point.  However, depending on which essences you used, you may see some tiny particles which resulted from mixing the scents together with alcohol and water. A great way to eliminate these particles is by freezing and filtering the fragrance, which will help solidify the particles. To do so, first pour your fragrance into a large glass bottle, screw the lid on tightly, and place it in your freezer overnight.  The following day, first place a coffee filter into your ceramic coffee dripper and put it on top of the same beaker you used to create the fragrance the day before (making sure it's been cleaned properly).  Next, pour your fragrance slowly through the filter and into the beaker.</p>

        <h3>Step 8: Bottling</h3>
        <p>Now your scent is ready for bottling.  Using a clean pippette, transfer the fragrance into the small bottles of your choice.  You can hand-write or print out your own customized labels.</p>
