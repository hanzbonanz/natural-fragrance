        <h3>My Path to Natural Perfumery</h3>
        <p>I've enjoyed perfume since I was a little girl, raiding the medicine cabinet to find my mother's small bottles of sweet-smelling oils. As a teenager my friends and I would peruse the scented fragrance ads in magazines, then we'd purchase them from a department store or sometimes settle for the cheap knock-off versions. We'd also go crazy over the less-expensive and popular "body sprays" which were all the rage back then. Finally in my twenties I thought myself trendy by splurging on what I considered high-end fragrances from names like Georgio Armani or Gwen Stefani. But as I approached my thirties, my path changed somewhat and I began to learn about and experiment with essential oils. Quite quickly my sense of smell became heightened, and suddenly the commercial fragrances I owned didn't quite smell right.  I'm not sure if it was the synthetic fragrance components or the chemical preservatives, but I've not been able to wear them since. Going to the mall became more tedious than ever, as the cheap fragrances sprayed liberally throughout clothing stores offended my nose like never before.</p>

        <h3>A Better Way to Smell and Be Smelled</h3>
        <p>The more I've experimented with natural fragrance, the more certain I've become that it is truly the optimal way to scent our bodies and our surroundings.  Essential oils and absolutes or "scent essences" as I call them, each have their  own unique and intricate scent profile. That profile can vary dramatically depending on the exact sub-species, where the plant was grown, which plant part was harvested, the time of year it was harvested, how the oil was distilled, and many other factors. The end result is that each batch of scent essence created is unique unto itself.  When we embrace this characteristic of individuality, we unlock the potential beauty of the oils. </p>

        <h3>Artisan Distillers</h3>
        <p>The heroes of the aromatic world are the small-scale distillers who grow or wild-harvest aromatic plants, and then use various techniques including steam distillation and CO2 extraction to create these precious aromatic oils. Since this niche market was partly created by demand from aromatherapists who tend to prefer purity, many of these distillers take care to use only plant matter which was either cultivated organically or harvested from pristine wild locations. </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>New Ingredients</h3>
        <p>The availability of scent essences has increased in recent years and is continuing to grow at a rapid pace.  New technology such as CO2 extraction has both allowed scent essences of new plant species to be captured, while decreasing reliance on chemical-dependent processes such hexane extraction. Specialty alcohol distillers have begun to produce organic alcohol of the necessary 190 proof, from plants including corn, wheat, grapes, and sugarcane. The result of these trends is that fragrance artists have more colors to paint with, and those who seek purity in ingredients can obtain them easily online.</p>

        <h3>Perfumery as a Craft</h3>
        <p>Learning the art of perfumery is similar to learning how to roast your own coffee, brew your own beer, or to knit your own sweater. As with any hand-crafted process, transitioning from  consumer to producer allows us to create small quantities of goods exactly suited to our own unique preferences. In doing so, we may uncover an ability to create products far superior to those which are produced in mass quantities. As the craft is practiced and more skill is gained, others may come to prefer our products as well. </p>

      <!-- <p>The fragrance industry has traditionally been shrouded in secrecy, and their are two reasons for this. The first is to avoid someone copying a successful formula, the second (and more disturbing) is so that they can include potentially hazardous synthetic chemicals in their formula. The FDA specifically allows this, since they consider a fragrance to be a confidential trade secret. </p> -->

        <h3>Sharing Our Knowledge with Each Other</h3>
        <p>This site was created in order to help people enjoy the beauty of natural fragrance. It can be difficult to find information on how to make your own perfumes and colognes naturally, so my goal is to share all that I've learned in order to help you do so. As this site develops over time, its core goal is to create and promote an OPEN SOURCE SCENT movement, where those who practice this craft can openly share fragrance-making techniques and formulas with each other. This concept is named after and inspired by the open-source software movement, which has proven that everyone benefits by the sharing of knowledge and building upon the work of others.</p>

        <h3>A Note from the Author</h3>

        <p>This project has allowed me to indulge in two of my favorite activities, natural fragrance and learning web development.  The concept of duality fascinates me, and when two seemingly unrelated interests can be merged into one cohesive project such as this, duality morphs into unity.  It's a pleasant experience.</p>

        <p>I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial or else gained some useful piece of knowledge from the site. If you're interested in learning more about my other projects or would like to get in touch, check out my personal <a href="http://www.hanna.so">website</a>.</p>
